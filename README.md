# SolitaireTest
A small program to test win rates of two strategies of playing Osmosis/Treasure Trove solitaire

If you don't want to run it, running two million games (1 million for each strategy, each time through using a copy of the same shuffled deck) shows a win rate of about 10% for the intuitive 'first play possible' strategy where you play any card as soon as legally possible, and a roughly 12.5% win rate using a 'last play possible' strategy where you play any card on the reserve as soon as you can, but only playing the last possible play of the stock each pass through the stock.
